# Project Wafa — Customer Retention Intelligence Platform

Falcon Bank UAE · MAIB AI 115 · Final Group Project

Wafa (وفاء) means loyalty — and it runs both ways. The platform listens to
customer messages in four languages, fuses what customers *say* with what
they *do*, decides a retention action through transparent rules, drafts the
outreach with an open LLM, and puts a human in front of every send.

## Quick start

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python training/train_lstm_classifier.py    # trains the M1 LSTM  (~1 min, CPU)
python training/train_churn_model.py        # trains the M2 churn model (seconds)
python app.py                               # launches the retention cockpit
```

`app.py` is the full 8-tab cockpit (Overview, Triage, Review queue, Analytics,
Model evaluation, Fairness & ethics, Audit log, Settings). All business logic
stays in `wafa/`; the UI layer is `dashboard/` (theme, scenarios, an API-ready
service layer in `dashboard/services.py`, one component module per tab).
`python app_simple.py` is the minimal single-screen fallback (demo insurance).
The Review queue batch-scores all 252 messages with the trained models at
startup and ranks them by fused risk; the Settings tab switches classifier
(LSTM ↔ fine-tuned) and drafting mode (Qwen ↔ templates) live.

Set `WAFA_USE_LLM=0` to run without Qwen (curated templates draft instead —
this is also the demo-insurance path). First LLM run downloads
`Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` (~1 GB) and caches it locally.

Smoke test (three demo scenarios end to end):
`python training/smoke_test.py`

Full evaluation pipeline (needs the extra training deps —
`pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`):

```
python training/make_unseen_testset.py       # unseen-template test set (honest eval)
python training/finetune_distilmbert_colab.py --task churn_signal --csv data/messages.csv
python training/finetune_distilmbert_colab.py --task issue_type  --csv data/messages.csv
python training/evaluate_models.py --with-llm  # bake-off -> models/bakeoff_results.json
```

The fine-tune runs on free Colab T4 (~2 min/task) or locally on CPU (~7 min/task);
move the `wafa_finetuned_*` folders into `models/`. Serve the fine-tuned pair in
the app with `WAFA_CLASSIFIER=finetuned` (default stays `lstm`).

Interface contracts live in [wafa/contracts.py](wafa/contracts.py) — every
module is testable against the mock factories there, so nobody is blocked by
anybody (brief §4).

## Design decisions (defended in the Architecture Design Document)

- **Multilingual-native, no translation step.** Hindi arrives romanized
  ("mera card decline ho gaya") — off-the-shelf hi→en translators expect
  Devanagari and standard language detectors misclassify it. The LSTM learns
  all four languages directly from the data; language ID is a transparent
  script/keyword heuristic.
- **`nationality_region` is never a model feature.** The data is generated
  with churn independent of region; a model using it learns bias. It is used
  only to audit score fairness (see `models/churn_eval.json`).
- **Logistic regression is the primary churn model** because its coefficients
  become the per-customer "why" on the dashboard; XGBoost is the benchmarked
  alternative.
- **Transparent rule table decides actions** — every fired rule is logged.
  Confirmed leavers route to the dignified goodbye; no retention pressure.
- **Offer economics:** monetary offers are capped at 2% of CLV, else the rule
  downgrades to a relationship-manager call.
- **Guardrailed drafting:** Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct writes under an explicit
  tone-constrained prompt (shown in the dashboard); drafts failing checks
  (urgency language, invented amounts, retention pressure in goodbyes) fall
  back to curated templates. The platform runs fully without the LLM.

## Honest findings (the marks live here)

- Template leakage, proven: every model scores ~perfectly on the random
  split, then collapses on the unseen-template set (`models/bakeoff_results.json`):
  LSTM 100% → 32% (issue), fine-tuned DistilmBERT 100% → 54%, vs chance 14%.
  The from-scratch LSTM memorized templates; pretrained multilingual
  representations generalize better.
- Zero-shot Qwen2.5-0.5B loses to every trained model on BOTH sets
  (~20–36% throughout) — at this scale, prompting is not a substitute for
  training. It also rated "I am leaving the UAE next month" as Low churn
  intent in testing.
- Serving recommendation: `WAFA_CLASSIFIER=finetuned` for novel/live inputs
  (best generalization); `lstm` stays the default for the scripted demo
  (instant load, perfect on the reference data).
- LSTM per-language check: 1 of 4 romanized-Hindi test messages missed its
  churn signal — small-sample fragility in the lowest-resource language;
  exactly what the §7 fairness check is meant to surface.
- Qwen wrote "Dear [Customer's Name]" during draft testing → placeholder
  guardrail added (plus urgency/invented-amount checks).
- Own-language outreach, measured (`models/outreach_language_check*.json`):
  Qwen2.5-0.5B wrote English for every non-English customer (0/6) and
  placeholders in 8/8 drafts — before AND after prompt hardening. Conclusion:
  at 0.5B, reliability comes from architecture, not prompting. All 8 outreach
  actions are now templated in all four languages, and a language-mismatch
  guardrail guarantees customers are answered in their own language.
